* Make Fundamental:
  1. Make rules:
     - Make rule doesn't start with tab.
     - Make rule must have colon.
     - In Make rules, left of the colon is the target and right is list of dependencies.
     - Each rule can have multiple targets. Each target in the list execute independently.
     - [[file:./Makefile::12][Example]]


  2. Make command:
     - Start with tab.
     - Can have multiple commands per rule, but must escape the new line "\"
     - [[file:./Makefile::12][Example]]

  3. Variable:
     - make reads the Makefile twice. In the first path, make reads the variable.
     - Variable reuse will cause confusing result. Be careful
     - [[file:./Makefile::17][Example]]

* Default rule: [[file:./make.txt::453][Manual]]
   - [[file:./Makefile::1][Example]]
     
* Implicit Rule: [[file:./make.txt::560][Manual]]
