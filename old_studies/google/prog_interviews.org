*** 15 Binary Search Tree:
    1. Given a sequence of sorted arrays, find the sorted union of these arrays:
       Input: An array of sorted arrays
       Output: an sorted arrays. 
       Solution: 
       a. Use a min-heap to store the pair (current_iter, end_iter) from each array.
       b. Iterate while min-heap is not empty.
       c. At each iteration:
         * pop the heap to add to the result. 
         * advance the current iterator, and push the new pair into the heap if the next iter != end iter.
