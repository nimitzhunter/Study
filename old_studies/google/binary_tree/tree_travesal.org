In a binary tree, there are three ways to traverse the entire tree:
1. Pre Order: visit, left, right 
2. In Order: left, visit, right
3. Post Order: left, right, visit


In pre-order traversal, at each node in the tree, we mark the node as visited and process it, then travel left until we reach the external node.
